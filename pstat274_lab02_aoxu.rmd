# Problem 1:

A white noise process is a random process of random variables that are uncorrelated, have mean zero, and a finite variance.

No, it doesn't have to be Gaussian.

# Problem 2:

Yes, there is a difference that variability of Moving Avg is smaller than WN. It suggests that Moving Average as a data processing technique can reduce the effect of random variation and help to determine the underlying trend.

```{r}
z_t <- rnorm(200,0,1)
y_t = filter(z_t, filter = rep(1/3,3), sides = 2, method = "convolution")
acf(y_t, na.action = na.pass, main="ACF")
```

# Problem 3:
```{r}
x_t <- filter(z_t,filter = c(1,-0.9),method = "recursive")
plot(x_t,xlab = "t",ylab = expression(x[t]),type = "l", main = "Autoregressive Model")
```

```{r}
x1 = arima.sim(n = 600, model = list(ar=c(1,-0.9))) 
plot.ts(x1, main="Autoregressive Model")
```
