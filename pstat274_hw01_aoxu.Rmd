Problem 4
```{r}
polyroot(c(1,-2))
polyroot(c(1,-0.45,0.05))
```

Problem 6
```{r}
# a
Z<- rnorm(300)
plot.ts(Z, xlab="Time", ylab="Z")
```
```{r}
acf(Z, main="ACF")
```
```{r}
# b
Y<- Z^2
plot.ts(Y, xlab="Time", ylab="Y")
```
```{r}
acf(Y, main="ACF")
```

# 6c
c1) There’s a difference between the plots of graphs of time series Z and Y that the graph of z is symmetrically distributed around 0 while the graph of Y is all above 0. 

But both of they are stationary since both of them have no trend or seasonality.

c2) There is no noticeable difference in the plots of acf functions ρZ and ρY. I would describe Y as a non-Gaussian white noise sequence based on my plots since 
it has 0 constant mean, variance and it is uncorrelated.
```{r}
# d
mean(Y)
mean(Z)
```
